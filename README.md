little scripts for dealing with Canvas, webwork, grades, etc


These are very basic and have very little error handling, if someone wants to add some, that's great.   


The speech recognition uses jellyfish to encode the names from the letters in the name, at some point I'd like to create an option where you can once at start of quarter just read the names into a file and get encodings of your own voice reading the names once and for all. 

The webwork python is used to update an exported Canvas file with an export Webwork file, it only works one entry at a time.  

Third is just small script that allows you to make a histogram of grades with mean and median, and allows you to edit the number of bins.
